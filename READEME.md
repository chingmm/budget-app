Approach Taken:
I combined a budget app design with data from the census.gov website for housing costs in order for the end user to be able to estimate their cost of living based on location.

States can be searched to view median mortgage/rent monthly costs for the state as well as a standard distribution of where costs are for the state.

For the budget app part, monthly expense/income amounts can be entered, along with a brief description. The inputs will generate transactions to view details of expenses/income as well as calculating totals with each new transaction.

Things I'd like to improve on if I had more time:
- Getting the distribution percents to show up in a different color when a state is entered. Color wasn't working with this one, and I ran out of time to figure out a fix.
- For negative dollar amounts, moving the dollar sign to be after the negative sign.
- Figure out how to pull in County/Place data for housing estimates, so that data can be more granular when getting monthly cost estimates
- Looking through the API data more to see if there's income by occupation in the census.gov website. If not this API, then looking into the Bureau of Labor Statistics API for this information.
